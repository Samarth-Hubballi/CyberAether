# AI Coding Agent - Cyberpunk Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from cyberpunk aesthetics found in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Matrix-inspired interfaces, and modern hacker terminals. The design emphasizes dark themes, neon accents, and futuristic UI elements.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Dark Mode Primary (Default)**:
- Background: 0 0% 8% (deep black-gray)
- Secondary Background: 240 10% 12% (dark blue-gray)
- Primary Accent: 180 100% 50% (cyan neon)
- Secondary Accent: 300 100% 60% (magenta neon)
- Text Primary: 0 0% 95% (near white)
- Text Secondary: 0 0% 70% (muted gray)
- Warning/Alert: 0 100% 60% (red neon)

### B. Typography
- **Primary Font**: JetBrains Mono (monospace for code aesthetic)
- **Secondary Font**: Inter (clean sans-serif for readability)
- **Accent Font**: Orbitron (futuristic headings)

### C. Layout System
Primary spacing units: 2, 4, 8, 16 (p-2, m-4, h-8, gap-16)
Grid-based layout with terminal-inspired sections and floating panels

### D. Component Library
**Core Elements**:
- Terminal-style code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Neon-bordered cards with subtle glow effects
- Glitch-effect buttons and interactive elements
- Floating panels with backdrop blur
- Progress bars with animated neon fills

**Navigation**: 
- Fixed header with glass morphism effect
- Animated hamburger menu for mobile
- Breadcrumb navigation with terminal path styling

**Forms**:
- Dark input fields with neon focus states
- Animated placeholder text
- Terminal-style validation messages

### E. Animations
- Subtle typing animations for code demonstrations
- Floating particle systems in background
- Smooth scroll-triggered reveal animations
- Glitch effects on hover for interactive elements
- 3D model rotations and environmental lighting changes

## 3D Elements & Visual Treatment
- **Hero Section**: Large 3D holographic code visualization
- **Interactive Models**: Floating geometric shapes representing AI processes
- **Background Elements**: Particle networks and data streams
- **Environment**: Neon-lit virtual space with depth and perspective

## Page Sections (Maximum 4)
1. **Hero**: Full viewport with 3D AI visualization and animated tagline
2. **AI Capabilities**: Interactive demo with live code generation
3. **About Developer**: Animated profile with skill matrix visualization
4. **Contact/CTA**: Terminal-style interaction form

## Images
- **Hero Image**: 3D rendered AI brain/neural network visualization
- **Developer Avatar**: Stylized cyberpunk portrait with neon accents
- **Background Textures**: Subtle circuit board patterns and data visualizations
- **Icon Set**: Minimalist tech icons with neon glow effects

The design should feel like an advanced AI interface from a sci-fi movie, balancing visual impact with functional usability for showcasing coding capabilities.
